<p>Whether you have all of your micro-services in a single repo or submoduled out, you can leverage Maestro for fast easy deployments, while keeping all of your source code in sync with what's deployed. By creating a dependency tree of each packagable groups of source code, submodules or plain subdirectories, and traversing the tree to find changes in git history, Maestro will only build what has changed and what depends on the changed packages.  Maestro also builds each sibling in the tree concurrently. Maestro will build any project.</p>

<p>Maestro was built with well packaged and portable software in mind.  First of which was Docker, which Maestro is optimized for faster builds, pushes and pulls of.  Other packaging tools such as other container image builders (ie rkt), and vm image packers such as Packer work well with Maestro as well. </p>

<p>The manager daemon will plug right into plenty of existing infrastructures, including Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos, AWS, and GCE.  It additionally supports a native runtime, running its own container runtime for isolation of each build.</p>
